# Scylla Split ErgoMech Keyboard

[Scylla from BK](https://bastardkb.com/scylla/), in work, currently putting all the stuff together and 3D-printing the parts

Planned configuration:

- Switches: Kailh Brown Silent
- Keycaps: TBD
- Controller: 2x Liatris

I am thinking about modifying the case to accomodate a Encoder and a OLED
